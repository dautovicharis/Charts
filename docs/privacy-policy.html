    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
Haris Dautović built the Charts app as
an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by
Haris Dautović at no cost and is intended for use as
is.
</p> <p>
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
</p> <p>
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
the collection and use of information in relation to this
policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p> <p>
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
Charts unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
</p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
For a better experience, while using our Service, I
may require you to provide us with certain personally
identifiable information. The information that
I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
</p> <div><p>
The app does use third-party services that may collect
information used to identify you.

Charts app does not engage in any data collection practices, including the gathering of log data. Your privacy is important to us, and we do not collect details about your device, internet protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, configuration of the app, time and date of use, or any other statistics.

Your experience with the Charts app is entirely private, and you can enjoy using it without any concerns about your information being collected or stored.

</p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
stored on your device's internal memory.
</p> <p>
This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
“cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
portions of this Service.

</p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
The Charts app operates without handling any user's data. As a result, no personal information is either transmitted or stored. 

</p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
that these external sites are not operated by me.
Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
services.
</p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <div><p>

The Charts app and its services are not designed for or directed at anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information, as this app does not have a backend server for data storage.


</p></div> <!----> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
I may update our Privacy Policy from
time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
periodically for any changes. I will
notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
this page.
</p> <p>This policy is effective as of 2024-02-05</p> <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p> <p>

Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at haris.dautovic.dev@gmail.com.
